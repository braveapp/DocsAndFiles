# DocsAndFiles
All Brave Co-op documentation and files are stored here. (Or, rather, they will be - as at May 25, 2017 we are just putting a few up here while we figure out the best way to manage this.)

These documents are provided in the hopes that they may be of some use: either by allowing you to use them for a project of your own, or to review our work to determine whether we are doing what we say we are doing. 

Brave engages in radical transparency as a demonstration of its committment to value of openness and and in an effort to contribute to the global commons.

All documentation here is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0</a>

A guide to the documentation, as well as how to ensure our documentation stays open, will be posted here in due course.
